# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - Iris Dataset 🌸

## Overview
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset. It is developed as part of an AI & ML internship under the guidance of Elevate Labs and MSME, Govt. of India. The objective is to build a KNN model, tune it with different values of `K`, and visualize the decision boundaries.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the working of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- Explore and preprocess the Iris dataset.
- Implement KNN using Scikit-learn.
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Visualize decision boundaries using the first two features.

## Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset and explore its structure.
   - Normalize features using Min-Max scaling.

2. **Model Implementation**
   - Use `KNeighborsClassifier` from `sklearn.neighbors`.
   - Train and test the model with various values of `K`.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

4. **Visualization**
   - Decision boundaries are plotted using the first two features.
   - Results are visualized with scatter plots and heatmaps.
